Module 9 SQL Assignment

I used PostgreSQL to create tables and then load the data from the CSV files into the tables.
From there, I created queries to analyze the data and provide answers for the challenge questions. 
Several queries were straightforward, but there were a few that required joining tables to crossreference data using primary and foreign keys.
